title: Zero(ji) to 60; Leveling Fast
---

The advised leveling spec for new hunters is Beastmaster all the way to 60 [(click here to see talent order)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/hunter/5000322151511051-150510304/0AEFGhjjkjjjmpnmmmmrrrrsr1BDeGajjjj).  The fastest leveling spec for hunter without a %xp buff from levels 1-40 is [Marksmanship](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/hunter/5000322041-52051030513051-03); you must be chain pull, kiting mobs without attempting to let your pet tank them for this to be a speed gain.  If you're new to the spec I highly recommend going Beastmaster; Pathfinder's movement speed and more pet damage to help your pet keep aggro are immense quality of life improvements to casual leveling.

# Pet and Weapon Progression

The most significant contributors to leveling speed and QoL are pet and weapon progression.  As mentioned in the [pet section]({{ site.baseurl }}/pet), screech pets (Owls and Vultures) are the recommended leveling pets as the debuff application of screech is the most threat / second of all the pet family skills.  When using a screech pet for threat, you should only have screech and growl set to autocast; you may want to teach them Claw for dungeons where screech can be frustrating to tanks but you should never have both autocasting.  Until you can get a screech pet, or in case you do not want one, cats will be the second best pets with Claw set to autocast (teaching and autocasting bite as well is a single digit dps gain with which the training points could be instead used for stamina/armor).

For bows, favor slower weapons if you are Marksmanship with a caveat that proc weapons like Venomstrike, Quillshooter, etc are a significant DPS gain at lower levels.  For Beastmaster, favor mostly the DPS stat of weapons with a slight awareness that faster weapons chew through ammo quicker.  **Always use the highest level ammo available to you.**  For efficient, fast levelers it is recommended to train staves early for weaving.
