Bouk's Phase 6 Lootapoloza 
=

The base of this document is ripped directly from  [Skinnay's Classic Gear List](https://gist.github.com/skinnay-dev/39f71f3cce1c64b95142f7e0e0d97bca), modified slightly, and updated to fit our current understanding of hunters in classic.  Please see his list for pre-phase 6 gear lists.

Phase 6 BiS is much simpler than previous phases as T3 is far and away better than most other gear in the game.  Stat weights and dps values are based on [Sixx's DPS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlB2P1kyV_QdD4ULQzvZvS6hK6BDouUQkyHQzCvBGI/edit#gid=333718892) and assume full buffs, consumables, and uptime on boss debuffs with 20/31/0 spec<!-- Todo link config -->. Weapon calculations assume absolute BiS armor and likewise, armor calculations assume absolutely BiS weapons.  DPS numbers are from stable rotations without use of haste effects or trinkets. 

As these sets are being simmed under pretty contrived settings (100% debuff, pet uptime, etc) the absolute DPS values of each set is fairly meaningless.  Gear upgrades should be compared relative to the pieces and sets they are replacing.  Likewise, Blessing of Kings (and Windfury when weaving) raises the top end DPS of all sets but do not meaningfully change how the sets compare to eachother.  As such, all sets are simmed with Blessing of Kings.  We've put the the simmed DPS of top end weave sets with Windfury in the notes column because melee hits go brrrrt.

Phase 6 introduces [Consecrated Sharpening Stones.
](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23122/consecrated-sharpening-stone)  Our best current knowledge indicates these work for ranged AP as well as melee.  AS such, we've simmed all sets with them applied.

<a name="sub1">1</a>: Swapping T3 gloves for Veklors is a -2 DPS substitution

Some alternatives to individual BiS items that do not affect the hit configuration:\
R12 Gloves > Veklor's Gloves > T2 Gloves\
Mantle of Wicked Revenge > Barrage Shoulders\
T2.5 Hauberk > T2 Chest = R13 Chest\
R13 Helm > T2.5 Helm > T2 Helm\
T2.5 Boots > T2 Boots\
Ring of the Godslayer > Circle of Applied Force\
Cloak of the Fallen God > Cloak of the Shrouded Mists

Melee weave rotation
===
- We assume [20/31/0](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/53000200505-05251030513051) due to Slaying talents affecting very few raid bosses in Naxx and AQ rather than the p3/4 [13/31/7](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/530002003-05251030513051-32002) spec.

Key differences for gear configurations:
* Agility weight relative to AP is lower than for pure ranged.
* Hit is now split into 2 parts, where the ranged hit scope, ranged weapon skill, and ranged AP are a bit less valuable, and you can still get some value from melee hit past the ranged cap. (e.g. 37 AP per hit = 32 per ranged hit + 5 per melee hit).
* Strength and melee AP are worth a small amount.
