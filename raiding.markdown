YOU PULL

# Buffs

Hunters get the short end of the buff stick.  Dire Maul Tribute's [Fengus' Ferocity](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22817/fengus-ferocity) is only melee AP.  Battle Chicken's [squak](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23060/battle-squawk) is only melee attack speed.  These buffs are only useful if you are melee weaving.  Hell, even the AP component of [Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22888/rallying-cry-of-the-dragonslayer) is only melee (luckily the crit does affect ranged attacks).

### Consumables
<!-- agi scroll, juju power, juj might -->
There are many guides for hunter consumes so I'm not going to recreate them here.  Just note: there are consumes for your ranged attacks, consumes for buffing your pet (yes, it makes a significant DPS increase), and consumes for melee weaving.

If nothing else, try to have [Elixir of the Mongoose](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13452/elixir-of-the-mongoose) and [Grilled Squid](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13928/grilled-squid) with you at all times.  [Greater Fire Protection Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13457/greater-fire-protection-potion) are key to protecting your Aimed Shot from suffering pushback on Firemaw, Vael, etc.
