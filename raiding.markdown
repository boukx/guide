# Buffs

In 1.12, hunters got the short end of the buff stick and did not receive benefits to their ranged attacks from many world buffs.  **This is fixed in era and seasons.**  You should collect all world buffs before raids if you want to perform optimally: [Darkmoon Faire Damage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23768/sayges-dark-fortune-of-damage) when available, [Dire Maul Tribute](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22817/fengus-ferocity) buffs, [Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22888/rallying-cry-of-the-dragonslayer), [Spirit of Zandalar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24425/spirit-of-zandalar), and [Songflower Serenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15366/songflower-serenade).  

[Warchief's Blessing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16609/warchiefs-blessing) haste only applies to melee so it's only useful for weaving or its mp5.  [Gnomish Battle Chicken's](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken) [Battle Squawk](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23060/battle-squawk) is only melee attack speed, but you should still have engi and have one for your party.

### Consumables

Optimal buff consumes for all hunters are [Elixir of the Mongoose](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13452/elixir-of-the-mongoose), [Grilled Squid](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13928/grilled-squid), [Juju Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12460/juju-might) for you and your pet, [Scroll of Agility IV](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10309/scroll-of-agility-iv) for you and your pet, [Scroll of Strength IV](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10310/scroll-of-strength-iv) for your pet, [Juju Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12451/juju-power) your pet, and [Consecrated Sharpening Stones](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23122/consecrated-sharpening-stone) for Undead otherwise [Brilliant Mana Oils](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20748/brilliant-mana-oil). 

You should consume and collect an additional [Ground Scorpok Assay](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8412/ground-scorpok-assay) from Blasted Lands and [Swiftness of Zanza](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20081/swiftness-of-zanza) before raid.  Zanza is especially important if weaving.

Weavers should additionally use [Juju Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12451/juju-power) on themselves, scroll themselves with [Scroll of Strength IV](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10310/scroll-of-strength-iv).  Horde weavers in windfury groups should not use stones/mana oil; Horde weavers outside windfury groups and all Alliance weavers should use [Consecrated Sharpening Stones](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23122/consecrated-sharpening-stone) on undead otherwise [Brilliant Mana Oils](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20748/brilliant-mana-oil) if it prevents you from running out of mana, otherwise [Elemental Sharpening Stones](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22757/elemental-sharpening-stone).

**All hunters should bring relevant elemental protection potions and encounter specific consumes.**  Namely, [Greater Fire Protection Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13457/greater-fire-protection-potion) prevent Aimed Shot pushback on Vael and Firemaw.  [Juju Chill](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12457/juju-chill) and [Juju Ember](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12455/juju-ember) have great value on resist fights.

You will also want to bring [Major Mana Potions](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13444/major-mana-potion) and [Dark Runes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20520/dark-rune) or [Demonic Runes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12662/demonic-rune).

[Juju Flurry](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12450/juju-flurry) is not worth using as it lowers the damage of your attacks by 3% for its duration.
