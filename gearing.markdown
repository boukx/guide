title: Waste Not, Want Not
---

[Simming](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIlB2P1kyV_QdD4ULQzvZvS6hK6BDouUQkyHQzCvBGI/edit?usp=sharing) is the only way to answer the question of "should I wear X or Y?"  Gear guides can tell you what to pursue, but simming is the end all for making the best of what you have.  For ally hunters, Skinnay already has a [list of simmed gear sets](https://gist.github.com/skinnay-dev/39f71f3cce1c64b95142f7e0e0d97bca).

Its notable that stat priorities change depending on your faction and rotation.  Alliance members will favor stats like Agi which are increased by kings and weavers will take notably worse weapons for ranged DPS so that their raptor strikes hit harder.

### T2

The T2 8 piece set bonus debuff has a proc rate of .5 ppm.  It takes up a debuff slot per proc; [if multiple procs overlap, it takes up multiple debuff slots.](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/zw8FcCnL19qxjhmR#hostility=1&type=auras&spells=debuffs&ability=23577&source=100&fight=last) though this doesn't matter in SoM. Each hunter wearing T2 in a raid slightly increases every other hunters DPS.

### Ranged Weapons

Hunter's ranged weapons are poorly described by tooltips.  DPS numbers are often misleading as slower weapons will do much better damage than faster ones.  Below is a list of hunter weapons tiered by their DPS for a tier 2 MM hunter and whether the weapons should be clipped.  Please be informed-- it is not worth taking a Striker's Mark or something similar from a melee when a blue dungeon weapon is better.  **Pre-raid BiS options in bold.**
