This started as an eclectic collection of notes I made in phase 2 classic for newer hunters.  When Season of Mastery launched I filled out the gaps to make a smoother journey for new hunters.  I hope this information is helpful to you

Vanilla hunter is a broken, cursed monstrosity of mediocre design and poor planning; it's nearly my favorite MMO class ever.  I hope this guide gives you the information on its quirks and bugs needed to enjoy the class for its weirdness.  

As always, if you have any questions please ask in the [Classic WoW Hunter Discord](https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr).

Finally, I want to acknowledge a few people for their contributions to this guide as well as their company and camaraderie throughout classic: thank you Zeroji for pushing the boundaries of hunter in classic as well as providing lots of details about leveling / progression and DMT optimization; thank you Runway for your contributions to hunter and especially your fanatic study of Diremaul; thank you Skinnay for your gearing information from classic and exemplary weaving; and thank you to Sixx, Brad, Aaki for support, friendship, and fun you've provided over the years.
