# Pets

Pets can do a considerable percentage of a hunter's damage even if they are not Beast Mastery hunters.  All hunters should focus on keeping their pet alive (pet uptime).  Hunters raiding BWL and MC should take the following pet skills to maximize damage: max fire resist, max shadow resist, max dash, max claw, rest in stamina.
